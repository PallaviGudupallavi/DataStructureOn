# DataStructureOn
**DataStructureOn** is a gamified web application designed to help users learn various data structure operations in an interactive and engaging way. This project aims to simplify the process of understanding complex data structures by providing a hands-on, game-like experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning:** Users can perform various operations on data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Gamified Experience:** Earn points, level up, and track progress while learning data structures.
- **Multiple Data Structures:** Includes commonly used data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Provides real-time feedback on the correctness of operations to ensure effective learning.
- **Leaderboards:** Compete with others by climbing the leaderboard based on performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** Firebase (optional, for real-time progress tracking)
- **Libraries/Tools:**
  - [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for visualizing progress
  - [Lottie.js](https://airbnb.io/lottie/) for animated learning demos
  - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for real-time database (if implemented)
